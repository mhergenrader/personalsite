				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>From September 2010 to May 2012, under the REU program funded by NSF, I researched discourse and sentiment patterns in online course discussion boards, using discussion threads annotated with Speech and Emotion Acts. I wrote two refereed publications (citations below) for the <a href="http://www.asee.org/">ASEE</a> Annual Conferences.</p>
				
				<p>In my first paper, I investigated the effects of different question-answer patterns (and who stated them) in the first two posts of a thread and how these Q&amp;A pairs correlated with factors like thread length and the number of unique students participating in the thread.</p>
				
				<p>For this task, I split the thread data set into "undeveloped" (two posts) and "developed" (more than two posts) to compare whether the Q&amp;A patterns of the first two posts led to any further development of the thread. From my analysis, I found that "how to" questions and direct answers, in accordance with intuition, tended to be associated more often with undeveloped threads, limiting possible further discussion. On the other hand, when questions appeared in both posts, regardless of whether the same student posted both, the threads tended to be more developed. Overall, in this paper and in my research, I found that certain question and answer types were a reasonably good indicator of whether the thread would continue and whether more users would be involved.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, I studied the correlation between the role of the first responder (student or instructor) and the thread length. In my results, matching intuition, when someone in an instructor role (e.g. professors or course assistants) answered directly with instructions, the threads tended to be undeveloped. When students responded in the second post, with either responses or questions, more engagement occurred, as seen in longer thread lengths and more users in the discussion.</p>
				
				<p>In my second paper, I looked at the correlation between the appearance of phrases denoting frustration and other variables. In particular, I observed the location of frustration in threads and whether this correlated with discussion length, poster diversity/count, and average first response times. I also then looked at whether frustration appearing in initial posts close to a project deadline affected these variables.</p>
				
				<p>To my surprise, the appearance of frustration in the initial post, and throughout the discussion, did not correlate with an increase in urgent responses or increased student involvement. This (lack of) trend was observed in general and when viewing threads close to a deadline. Also, no significant correlation was found between the length of posts (measured in number of tokens) that contained frustration and response times.</p>
				
				<p>In all of my research here, I labeled posts with <em>Speech Acts</em> and <em>Emotion Acts</em>, tagging frustration and question/answer types. To direct this labeling effort, I helped develop manuals that set out the criteria for and examples of each annotation type. To reduce bias from my own labeling decisions, I led a group of two other students to create independent annotation sets on the same posts. I wrote Python comparison tools that visualized our disagreements, leveraging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa">Cohen's Kappa measure</a> to determine our level of agreement. After discussing and reconciling our annotations, I added the agreed-upon annotations to the data set, ultimately creating a data set with four semesters of tagged posts.</p>
				
				<p>Outside of the statistical investigations in my publications, I become certified to handle sensitive data and looked into whether the appearance of frustration and other factors would impact project grades. Employing supervised classification algorithms like C4.5 decision trees and Naïve Bayes via WEKA API's, I started exploring whether certain dialogue acts were predictive of passing/failing project grades, finding that a number of confident answer posts that a student posted near the deadline was quite a strong indicator of whether (s)he received a passing grade. While this research was more experimental than publication-ready, I gained my first valuable experience in applying classification algorithms.</p>

				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>From September 2011 to May 2012, I conducted research in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese (enrolled in SPAN-490x), presenting an <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/spanish/the-honors-program/">Honors Thesis</a> in the second semester, the first thesis having a computational linguistics focus in the department. For my investigation, I looked at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectology">dialectology</a> of Spanish and Portuguese via a corpus composed of canonical works, stories/essays written by anyone, and tweets from a variety of countries. Overall, I wanted to understand whether certain words and phrases in written works of different countries were particularly indicative of their associated dialect.</p>
				
				<p>This was a great experience for me in building my own training corpus from scratch. I scraped a multitude of sources (many with errors), set everything to a common encoding, and decomposed all documents into sets of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, selecting the top 2,500 from each set that were not purely consisting of structural words. I then created training examples, one per document, with features being the binary appearance of each N-gram instance in the document and the label (22 in total) being the country from which the document originated. I chose this setup and below classifier from two considerations: (a) the very large size of the training, development, and test sets (I wanted to train in an efficient manner) and (b) my focus on the individual correlations between these N-grams and their corresponding countries.</p>
				
				<p>In the end, leveraging my budding machine learning experience from ISI and IBM, I implemented a multivariate (Bernoulli) Naïve Bayes classifier in C++ and applied it to these sets to determine which N-grams were most/least characteristic of different countries and their associated dialects, using a one-vs-rest strategy. I selected as representative phrases those with the highest positive one-vs-rest label odds in each country. Under the unigram model, there were certainly some intuitive results, like <em>gauchos</em> appearing more often in Argentine texts and exports like <em>cacao</em> in Ecuadorian ones. An interesting revelation was the spelling changes in the Peruvian dialect, in which <em>fortunato</em> and <em>callao</em> (with the <em>d</em> in the more standard participle <em>callado</em> dropped) received highly representative scores.</p>
				
				<p>There were certainly some challenges in the research for this paper. The bigram and trigram models did not produce results that were as significant as I expected. In addition, the relative lack of texts from some African countries, like Equatorial Guinea (Spanish) and Namibia (Portuguese), made reasoning about their representative phrases more difficult and less impactful for them. Finally, I believe I could have further improved the preprocessing to avoid capturing some collocations that still had a single structure word in them. However, despite these challenges, I learned a great deal about multi-class classification, proper corpus building, scraping, preprocessing, and sentence tagging. And I even found an interesting highlight: the high odds of English phrases (“happy birthday,” “i love you”) in Mexican documents, hinting at the increased sharing between American English and Mexican Spanish.</p>
				
				<p>Beyond my paper, I also, from my constructed Naïve Bayes model, ran prediction over the test sets of texts to determine whether my classifier could correctly predict the country of origin. Unfortunately, the simplicity of my classifier, relying on simple N-grams with no backoff, revealed some underfitting, underscoring the need for possible extensions like observing syntactical differences (word order, sentence length, etc.) as well, in addition to trying more sophisticated classifiers. Another broader extension I'd like to pursue would be to classify dialects from spoken language materials.</p>
