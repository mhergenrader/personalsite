					<h2><a id="goals">Goals</a></h2>
					<p>I have always had an aptitude and fascination for the intricacies of human languages, studying English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, German, Greek, Catalan, and Italian in depth at different points in my life. Coupled with this long-standing interest has been my fascination by the increasing ability of machine learning algorithms to capture understanding of languages and accomplish tasks like translation, reading, speech recognition, generation, dialogue parsing, question-answering, and more.</p>
					
					<p>I want to understand in depth how machine learning methods can work so well with natural language tasks. I want to advance these methods to better our usage, understanding, and applications of language. <strong>To address these curiosities and goals, I want to pursue a long-term career in machine learning and natural language processing research</strong>.</p>
					
					<p>To this end, I am applying to Stanford's Master's in Computer Science program (through the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin1112/4832.htm">HCP</a> program), with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, for the Autumn 2016 quarter. I believe Stanford's program will provide me with not only a deep, formalized background in machine learning and NLP (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13IN1gbwUjA-o7iZiIOibrUrAP_KO9NQpujFXY6gndj8/edit#gid=0">my potential course plan</a> to this end) but also exposure to its groundbreaking research in these areas, research I want to delve into and contribute to as I look toward pursuing a Ph.D.

					<h2><a id="research-interests">Research Interests</a></h2>
					
					<p>My current interests are <strong>neural network</strong> and <strong>deep learning models</strong> leveraged for <strong>sequence learning tasks</strong> like <strong>Machine Reading, Machine Translation, and Automatic Speech Recognition</strong>. I’m awestruck by their inherent capacity to address classically difficult problems in language processing and understanding: variable length structures handled natively by Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM's, sparsity handled by dense vectors through word embeddings, the automatic focus on relevant pieces of large inputs via attention mechanisms. And the capability of deep, hierarchical models to automatically learn new higher level features represents precisely the understanding of language inputs that excites me about this intersection between machine learning and natural language.</p>
					
					<p>After Professor Chris Manning first sparked my interest in these models in <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/">CS 276</a>, I spent the summer of 2015 building up a good understanding of these model architectures. During this time, I took Geoffrey Hinton's Neural Networks course via Coursera, and though I was not able to officially join the Neural Networks pilot course offered by the Google Brain team, I completed it as well, following its materials on my own schedule. This autumn, taking <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS 224n</a> at Stanford, I aim to use my final project to conduct a deeper exploration into attention-based models and their applications to Machine Translation or Machine Reading.</p>
					
					<p>Longer term at Stanford, I want to contribute to the research and advancement of these groundbreaking model architectures, working in <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/">NLP group</a> and pursuing a Distinction in Research.</p>
