					<h2><a id="goals">Goals</a></h2>
					<p>I have always had an aptitude and fascination for human languages, studying English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, German, Greek, Catalan, and Italian in depth at different points in my life. Also piquing my interest has been the increasing ability of machine learning algorithms to help us better understand languages at scale and accomplish difficult high-level human tasks like translation, reading, speech recognition, generation, dialogue parsing, question-answering, and more.</p>
					
					<p>I want to understand in depth how machine learning methods can work so well with natural language tasks. I want to advance these methods to better our usage, understanding, and applications of language. <strong>To address these curiosities and goals, I am working toward a long-term career in machine learning and natural language processing research</strong>. As I next step, I aim to build a deeper, more theoretical background in this space to prepare me for a Ph.D. program.</p>
					
					<p>To this end, I am applying to Stanford's Master's in Computer Science program (through the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin1112/4832.htm">HCP</a> program), with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, intending to enter in the Autumn 2016 quarter. I believe this program will not only help me to develop a formal understanding of machine learning and NLP (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13IN1gbwUjA-o7iZiIOibrUrAP_KO9NQpujFXY6gndj8/edit#gid=0">my potential course plan</a> to this end) but also provide me with unique opportunities to contribute to groundbreaking research in these areas.</p>

					<h2><a id="research-interests">Research Interests</a></h2>
					
					<p>My current primary interest - among others - lies in <strong>neural and deep sequence models</strong> like recurrent and recursive neural networks. I’m awestruck by the their capacity to handle variable-length sequences of correlated inputs (structures inherent to natural languages), representing them in compact vector representations. Moreover, the capability of deeper networks to uncover useful higher-level sequence features is an exciting opportunity to help us better understand human languages.</p>
						
					<p>With the goal of improving sequence learning tasks like <strong>Machine Reading and Machine Translation</strong>, I want to research architectures and methods that address the vanishing gradient problem that occurs in training deep neural and sequence models, allowing models to better capture correlations between inputs separated by long distances. In particular, I aim to explore and develop variants of gating mechanisms, like Long Short-term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units; attention mechanisms; and newer external memory-based architectures like Memory Networks, of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916">Weston et al., 2015</a>, and Neural Turing Machines, of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401">Graves et al., 2014</a>.</p>
					
					<p>After Professor Chris Manning first sparked my interest in these models in <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/">CS 276</a>, I spent the summer of 2015 building up a good understanding of the various model architectures and methods out there. During this time, I took Geoffrey Hinton's Neural Networks course via Coursera, and though I was not able to officially join the Neural Networks pilot course offered by the Google Brain team, I completed it as a self-study. My most recent course, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS 224n</a>, solidified my interest in improving sequence model training for higher-level tasks of long inputs. It also exposed me to Stanford's innovative contributions to this class of models.</p>
					
					<p>Longer term at Stanford, I want to contribute to the research and advancement of these model architectures, working in the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/">NLP Group</a> and pursuing a Distinction in Research.</p>
