				<h2><a id="general">General Interests</a></h2>
				<p>In addition to my interest in machine learning/NLP and my job at Google, I also enjoy:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Reading &amp; writing fiction in various languages!</strong> I've collected over 500 foreign language books and have read 466 of them, digging into the techniques that makes these writers so talented. I really enjoy practicing writing short stories in various languages, most notably Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin. I want to write a novel in one or more of them someday, either by my own hand or through generative algorithms.</li>
					<li><strong>Snowboarding!</strong> I spent my formative years growing up outside Denver, CO and went to the mountains every winter with my family for years, something I still do.</li>
					<li><strong>Running!</strong> My first half marathon and weight loss made me hooked. I enjoy a healthy lifestyle and run wherever I go, most recently on the Jersey Shore.</li>
					<li><strong>Learning math!</strong> While important for my career goals, math by itself is also fun and fascinating! I'm currently working my way through some Measure Theory textbooks, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Measure-Theory-Second-Edition/dp/0120652021">this one</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Programming!</strong> Whether it's to learn languages like Haskell, to automatically check in for airlines, to <a href="projects.html#twilightlegion">program games for 160x100 grayscale screens</a>, or to try new ML algorithms, I like to just spend time expanding my coding repertoire.</li>
					<li><strong>Traveling!</strong> For each new place I go, I spend about 3-6 months ahead of time learning the local customs, language, and accent. My enriched experiences in these places, connecting at a deeper level to those that live there, have made these investments invaluable.</li>
					<li><strong>Exploring the Bay Area!</strong> There are so many amazing restaurants, trails, vineyards, sports venues, etc. around here! I try to find new locations every week.</li>
					<li><strong>Playing card &amp; board games!</strong> There's nothing quite like a good game of Munchkin, Scrabble, Quelf, Risk, Rummy 500, or Monopoly enjoyed with friends.</li>
					<li><strong>Tying knots!</strong> After picking up several knots in Boy Scouts (and becoming the fastest person to tie a bowline that I know ☺), I learned a lot more of them in my Sailing course at USC and have just been generally fascinated by all kinds of knots.</li>
				</ul>

				</div>
					
				<p>Though I've been active all my life (soccer, ultimate frisbee, cross country, racquetball, snowboarding), during a few years in college and out in the "real world," I gained weight due to improper nutrition and scarce time allotted for regular exercise.</p>
				
				<p>In July 2014, I set out to regain a healthy weight. Soon after I began, challenged by my coworkers and fueled by the plentiful healthy food options at Google, I signed up for my <a href="http://runsf.com/">first half marathon</a> in San Francisco (which luckily started and finished ~0.5 miles away from my apartment ☺). </p>
				
				<p>Over a period of fourteen weeks training every weekday morning at the Google gym, running increasing distances on Saturdays in SF, and following a strict, balanced diet, I lost 42 pounds and eight inches off my waistline. I completed my first half marathon in <a href="http://onlineraceresults.com/race/view_race.php?race_id=44254&submit_action=select_result&re_NO=2846#racetop">1 hour, 40 minutes</a>, finishing in the top 5% of all runners. And at the end of the year, five months since I had started, I had lost 50 pounds, dropping from 200 to 150.</p>
				
				<p>Though I am busier now with work, part-time graduate school courses, and other commitments, and therefore not able to train at the same intensity, I have maintained a healthy weight and regular exercise.</p>

				<h3>My Diet</h3>
				
				<p>I could present my entire diet log here, but I do believe in YMMV, especially when it comes to diet and weight management. Thus, I just include here some of the general ideas that I subscribed to. I naturally include also an official disclaimer: my plan has worked for me, but it does not guarantee it will work for others. I am not a licensed nutritionist or trainer by any means.</p>
				
				<p>Overall, I didn't follow any specific "fad" diet: I just kept my portions smaller, my meals balanced with healthier foods of simpler preparation, lower sugar, and higher protein, and well hydrated. In fact, on the last point, I now only drink water (with the occasional alcoholic beverage at social events).</p>
				
				<p>At Google during breakfast and lunch, I followed the "traffic light" labelings of different foods, in which green indicates one should eat many of them while red means eat only on occasion (like sumptuous desserts and the like). Particular foods that I grew a taste for were steamed vegetables (particularly bok choy and cauliflower), quinoa, egg whites, blueberries, Greek/Icelandic yogurt, kale, avocados, mushrooms, fish, and grapes. Many of my breakfast meals were the same every morning: one cup of egg whites and the rest of the plate filled with steamed vegetables like carrots or cabbage. Lunch was much more diverse, but still limited in portion size and containing foods of simple preparation (e.g. nothing fried or heavily processed). I'll be the first to admit my dinners were a bit strange, but they were very low in calories: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolani">Bolani</a> flatbreads (potato, spinach, lentils, etc.) with associated spreads like jalapeno and basil. The local San Francisco Farmers' Markets had, along with many vegetable options, these flatbreads at every event, and they became a regular staple for me (I still eat them). Dessert was limited to a small item once per week, and consumed only if I had improved that week.</p>
				
				<p>On top of food selection and portion control, I also used techniques like calorie counting and measurements, on the scale and with a measuring tape.</p>
				
				<p>For calorie counting, I looked at my Basal Metabolic Rate and researched a few sites on what a healthy calorie intake was for losing weight (NOTE: as you approach lower weights, the BMR goes down, so assuming the same routine, weight loss becomes harder!). I then either checked food labels or estimated at each meal, overestimating the count for items if I wasn't sure.</p>
				
				<p>For measurements, the critical ideas I kept in mind (and think others should too) are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't obsess over the number. Only check your trend. Is your weight increasing, stagnant, or decreasing? Are you sure you know why that is? (i.e. don't just significantly cut calories) Note that intake of items like water (zero calories) can significantly change the weight figure itself, so don't focus on it too much. Focus more on how you feel, look, and measure.</li>
					<li>Don't measure too often. I would weigh myself every day at the same time for consistency but only do full body measurements once per week. Too many measurements could just introduce noise.</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<p>One final item I think is worth emphasizing is this: <strong>gradual is best</strong>. Cutting calories to an extreme level instantly is not advised. Weight loss should not be considered a burden; it's more of an adjustment, one that requires patience. I think the best things about losing weight, apart from the weight loss itself, were the feeling of achievement and the expansion of my palate. Regarding the latter, I found many new foods I've really come to enjoy.</p>
				
				<h3>My Workout</h3>
				
				<p>Before discussing my workout details, I should mention a facet of my weight loss program that I found particularly effective, in contrast to how I had gone about it in the past. This was starting just the diet changes first, <em>gradually</em> reducing my portions/eating healthier (e.g. substituting one meal item at a time), <em>after</em> which I started a workout routine that I built up.</p>
				
				<p>Specifically, I spent about three weeks just starting to eat better before even working out, and this was incredibly effective for my mindset of treating this as a long-term process. Yes, I was doing all this to look better and weigh less, but through the gradual nature, I accepted this whole program as a lifelong commitment. In my mind, "committing" to a twelve-week, temporary program wouldn't be enough; committing to a long-term fitness goal, to a <em>lifestyle reformulation</em>, was a much stronger motivator than just hitting the treadmill for twelve weeks.</p>
				
				<p>And I believe this gradual buildup had a couple of additional benefits: I felt less internal pressure about hitting my goals too slowly/setting expectations too high, and the workouts started easier for me. On the latter point, had I just jumped into a workout routine on Day 1, it would have been much more difficult, since the long-standing lack of nutrition would not support my body.</p>

				<p>Regarding workouts, I built up gradually from one hour to two and a half hours (7 - 9:30 AM), five days per week, at the Google gym. I would eat nothing before a workout, drink water during, and end with a healthy breakfast high in protein immediately after. And each Saturday, I ran increasingly long distances, covering the same course I would run in San Francisco for the half marathon. Sundays were pure rest days, which were very much needed.</p>
				
				<p>At the gym on weekdays, I always went through three segments: cardio, weight training (alternating upper and lower body days), and core training. Cardio started at just 20 minutes at a brisk run pace on the treadmill until I then expanded into the elliptical, my station of choice (given its relatively lower pressure on my joints). On the elliptical, I added about five minutes per week, always keeping the same incline at 10 and resistance at 10. I tried to maintain about 170 or above RPM, with some days much higher to push myself. At the height of my training, I would do 80 minutes at 190 RPM on the elliptical, followed by 40 minutes on the exercise bike, then weight training, intense core exercises, and foam rolling.</p>
				
				<p>For weight training, I effectively just maintained a static set of exercises for my upper body (i.e. non-isolation exercises): bench press, dumbbell fly, lat pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, and tricep pulldowns. For lower body, I did squats, leg press, calf press, inner and outer thigh resistance, leg curls, and quad raises. Though the same exercises were conducted each week, I continually increased the weight, provided I maintained good form.</p>
				
				<p>For core exercises, I also kept it simple but increased the repetitions: crunches, side crunches, planks, and resistance leg lifts. At the end of each workout, I would do a thorough stretch and foam roll to avoid injury.</p>
				
				<p>As the race approached, I ran about 2-3 half marathons per week, choosing some weekdays to be runs instead of days in the gym. Though this was helpful for training for the event, I learned after that this pace was more prone to injury, so I ensured that the weight training continued regularly.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>

				<p>All in all, this experience was so fulfilling, not just in my achievement in losing weight, but because I really did change my habits to become much healthier in all aspects of life. Even if I cannot find the time to train as intensely as before, I walk places much more, eat better food, save treats for special occasions, sleep much better, and lead a much healthier lifestyle overall.</p>
				<p>My gradual approach to this process reminded me of the much touted "growth mindset" in today's psychology: at the beginning, I had no idea if I could ever run 13.1 miles. But from constant training, enjoying the buildup itself, and following the simpler goals of becoming better every day and maintaining a long-term lifestyle of good habits, I believe the weight loss was just a small piece of my total fulfillment.</p>
